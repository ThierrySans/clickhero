###Description of web application

As Toronto has really bad weather during the winter, people are afraid of going out to the supermarket and by food,
Or people like students are just too busy (lazy) to walk out and feed themselves.
Instead of spending 20 bucks ordering a pizza which is not tasty,
or spending much more money ordering good food.
Why don't you buy ingredients and cook for yourself?
Here we are buliding a platform for online supermarket and delivery.
Without steping out to the cold weather, order ingredients online!
If you have never cooked before, now you have a great chance!
Get recipes and ingredients from our platform and you are good to go.
If you are a good cook, don't be shame to share your cooking secret.
Help each other and do not starve again!
