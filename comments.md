If you promise your app will order groceries and deliver, it has to work for the final demo. As I said in class, I do not want a prototype or a proof of concept. You need to have something that work. 

If you only have the recipe feature, your app is not technically challenging. One person can put it out together in couple of days. 

I doubt you can expect higher than a C grade for this project if your app does not live up to better expectations.
